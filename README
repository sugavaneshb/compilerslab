These are the lab exercises that were done during the course "CS405 Principles of Compiler Design"

*DISCLAIMER: I am not sure whether all the code works the way they want to. So, Use them at your own risk. 

Comment if you would like to recommend to make some changes to the code to perform better :) 

Thanks!
